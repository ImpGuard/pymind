IDEA:
	neural network -> some metric value

SPEC:
	Input: A neural network
	Output: Runs some function on the neural network and returns the value[1]

DETAILS:
	[*] Similar in concept to activationfn and errfn, see those files for reference.
	[*] Generalized class function must be implemented first, specific metrics can be added later.
