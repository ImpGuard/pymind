Goals
=====

Easily split data into parts
Easily create a builder that acts as a NN generator
Easily run CV tests on a NN or on several NN (through a generator)
- So we can easily say, test learn_rate between 0 to 100 with a step size of 1
  and and...(1) print out minimums, pick the best (2) print all results
- Should be able to do generator customizing anything we want, pass in a generator?
  (with common ones already made?)
Visualize with quick and dirty graphs that do common tasks (identify intersections etc.)

X Easy to customize how pymind works (pluginnable)

Questions
========
Is a front end required or can everything just be a component?
