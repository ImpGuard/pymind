--------
Make sure you have python, pip, and virtualenv installed. It is also
preferred if numpy and scipy are installed globally already, otherwise it
will be installed locally in the virtualenv.

    git clone repo_url somedir # Clone the repo
    cd somedir
    virtualenv environment_name # Create virtualenv
    source environment name/bin/activate # Activate the environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Install any necessary modules
